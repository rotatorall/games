        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince features homages to Legend Of Zelda games old and new, including a nod to the infamous Kaepora Gaebora.
		Indie publisher Playtonic Friends (Yooka-Laylee, Lil Gator) and developer Castle Pixel (Rex Rocket) have just announced Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince, a pixelated 2D throwback to classic Legend Of Zelda games that also contains a few clever nods to the series’ more modern 3D adventures. This is also a sequel to 2017’s indie dungeon crawler Blossom Tales: The Sleeping King for Steam and Nintendo Switch, which was praised by old-school gaming fans for capturing the whimsical feel of titles like Legend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past in a modern experience.

As was the case in The Sleeping King, Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince will put players on an epic journey through a magical kingdom in the top-down style of old-school Legend Of Zelda titles, solving puzzles and battling a variety of dangerous enemies. What sets The Minotaur Prince apart is branching paths that can shape the player’s experience, including the ability to choose which boss they can battle against at the end of a certain dungeon. Interested gamers got their first look at Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince at yesterday’s IndieLand 2021 livestream, which is working to raise money for dementia research on top of providing indie publishers and developers with a platform to show off their latest projects.

        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/Dying_Light_2_new.jpg" alt="" data-image-width="1024" data-image-height="573">
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">The next "Dying 2 Know" showcase for Dying Light 2 will air Thursday, July 1.&nbsp;<br>Developer Techland announced the upcoming stream in a short teaser shared with the press. For now, all we know is that the show will start at 12pm PT / 3pm ET / 8pm BST over on the Techland&nbsp;Twitch&nbsp;page. The teaser video suggests that we're in for a look at some new zombie types, but that's admittedly just a guess.&nbsp;Dying 2 Know is one of two semi-regular series that Techland uses to release new information on&nbsp;<u>Dying Light 2</u>, with the other being a traditional Q&amp;A with the development team. The first episode in the series was released in May, and it gave us just over 30 minutes of details ranging from an interview with the voice of protagonist Aiden to fresh gameplay. Here's hoping the second episode is comparably informative.<br>
          <br>A new report from&nbsp;<u>Game Informer</u>, who spoke to Techland ahead of the July 1 show, suggests that the next Dying 2 Know will touch on factions, the makeup of the game's central city, multiplayer interactions, the virus-detecting wristband Aiden was wearing in an earlier trailer, and a variant zombie, among other things.&nbsp;<br>

        <img class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/1621257279_1280x720.jpg" alt="" data-image-width="1280" data-image-height="720" data-href="https://nicepage.com">
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Mario Golf: Super Rush lives up to its name in most ways. This is golf where someone has leaned on the fast-forward button and the pressure to swing and slice as quickly as possible is just as important as accuracy. That pace also extends to the game’s design, where every mode feels like it’s been designed to be devoured swiftly instead of savored. Unfortunately, the one aspect where nominative determinism doesn’t come into play is the ‘Super’ part.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Although it’s been a while since Mario and his mates hit the green, Mario Golf: Super Rush will feel familiar to anyone who has played an arcade-y golf game in the past few years, such as Everybody’s Golf. It’s overflowing with color, from the vivid courses you play on to the cast of characters (and your Mii) who you play as, and offers up plenty of different rulesets so you know that this&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;the sort of stuffy golf you see plastered over Sky Sports. Except, this outing for Mario on the links never captures a specific style, neither as a serious sports game that yearns to be mastered nor a whippy delight that craves to be played with mates.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>This identity crisis starts with how you play the game. Depending on which mode you’re playing, you’ll have a choice between traditional button controls or the arm-flinging of motion controls. Your button controls offer more command over where your ball goes, as you set power on a meter with a tap of A and add sidespin afterwards by nudging the left stick. While it’s not quite as simple as that suggests - a red gauge next to your power meter indicates how far a ball can curve unexpectedly if you put too much power on a shot - but it doesn’t quite capture the rhythmical compulsion of Everybody’s Golf, that sense of timing and strategy coming together. Meanwhile, motion controls are what you expect - swing your arms like it’s 2007 and you’re trying out Wii Sport for the first time. How enjoyable that is depends on personal preference, but I certainly made the most of an afternoon taking turns with my partner to see who could look the daftest while playing with them.<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">For much of 2020, Asobo Studio had its head in the clouds. While airports around the globe came to a standstill, the French developer was putting the finishing touches on&nbsp;Microsoft Flight Simulator, offering a timely invitation to bright and beautiful getaways across the real-time airspace of planet earth. But after a brief stint in those digital skies, Asobo's focus is back deep amongst the grit and grime of terra firma, entrenched within the war-torn ravages of 12th century France.&nbsp;<br>One of the many new&nbsp;E3 2021 games&nbsp;revealed over the Summer,&nbsp;A Plague Tale: Requiem&nbsp;is the studio's next project, as the direct sequel to its 2019 action-adventure hit,&nbsp;A Plague Tale: Innocence. The brief cinematic teaser for the game didn't reveal much, but confirms that we'll be reunited with sibling protagonists Amicia and Hugo de Rune, with a launch slated for next year exclusively on next-generation consoles and PC (it'll also be available on Nintendo Switch via cloud streaming).&nbsp;With A Plague Tale: Innocence's next-gen update recently hitting&nbsp;Xbox Series X/S and&nbsp;PS5, in the Year of the Rat no less, now is thus the perfect time to catch up with Asobo's first original IP. Arriving in the same period as some of the best-action adventure games of our time, it was easy to let Innocence slip past you for better-known titles with bigger development budgets and marketing campaigns. But to keep it forever off your backlog would be to miss out on a quietly exceptional pilgrimage across a rarely explored slice of history, and the beginnings of what could well be one of the most promising new IPs of the last generation.
